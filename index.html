  	        <h2 class="box1-title1">The Most Arty Creatures</h2>
  	        <h3 class="box1-title2">BUTTERFLIES</h3>
  	        <p class="box1-p1">A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved.The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants, which their larvae (caterpillars) feed on, and their adults feed and lay their eggs on. They have a long-lasting history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa.[2] The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below.</p>
  	        <p class="box1-p2">Like moths, butterflies have four wings covered with tiny scales. When a butterfly is not flying, its wings are usually folded over its back. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. There are many different kinds of butterflies. The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught.</p>
  	        <h3 class="box1-p-title">Predators</h3>
  	        <div class="box1-decordiv"></div>
  	        <p class="box1-p3">The main predators of butterflies are birds, just as the main predators of the crepuscular moths are bats. Also monkeys and tree-dwelling reptiles are predators, and some insects and spiders. Certainly all reptiles and monkeys have good colour vision, so that butterfly coloration works just as well on them as it does on birds.</p>

  	     <p class="box2-text">Butterflies go through a life cycle. A butterfly has four stages in its life cycle. Each stage is different. Each stage also has a different goal. A butterfly becoming an adult is called metamorphosis. The life cycle process can take a month to year. It depends on the type of butterfly.</p> 
         <h2 class="box2-title1">Stage 1: Eggs</h2>
         <div class="decordiv"></div>
         <p class="box2-text2">In the first stage a girl butterfly lays eggs. A butterfly first starts out as an egg. A girl butterfly lays the eggs on a leaf. She lays the eggs really close together. The eggs are really small and round. About five days after the eggs are laid. A tiny worm-like creature will hatch from the egg.</p>
         <h3 class="box2-title2">Stage 2: Caterpillar (Larve)</h3>
         <div class="decordiv2"></div>
         <p class="box2-text3">The second stage is the caterpillar. A caterpillar is sometimes called larve. A caterpillar is a long creature. It looks like a worm. Most caterpillars have a cool pattern. This pattern has stripes or patches. The caterpillar is hungry once it has hatched. It starts to eat leaves and flowers. It eats these all the time. It first eats the leaf that it was born on. This is the eating and growing stage.</p>
         <p class="box2-text4">A caterpillar grows really fast. This is because they eat a lot. A caterpillar is really small when it is born. It starts to grow fast. This is because it eats all the time. It grows so fast that it becomes too big for its skin. So the caterpillar has to shed its old skin. It then gets new skin. Caterpillars shed their skin four or more times while they are growing. A caterpillar shedding its outgrown skin is called molting.</p>

         <h3 class="stage3-title">Stage 3: Chrysalis (Pupa)</h3>
         <div class="decordiv3"></div>
  	     <p class="stage3-text">Stage three is the chrysalis. This is when the caterpillar is done growing. The caterpillar makes a chrysalis. Another name for a chrysalis is a pupa. It is mostly brown or green. It is the same color as the things around it. Things like the trees, leaves, or branches. This is so that other animals cannot see it. This protects them. This keeps them from getting hurt.</p>
  	     <p class="stage3-text2">This is the resting stage. It also is the changing stage. The caterpillar starts to changes. It starts to turn into a butterfly. It starts to look different. Its shape starts to change. It changes quickly. It then turns into a butterfly. All this happens in the chrysalis. This does not take a long time.</p>
  	     <h3 class="stage4-title">Stage 4: Butterly (Adult) (Imago)</h3>
  	     <div class="decordiv4"></div>
  	     <p class="stage4-text">In stage four, the chrysalis opens. Soon a butterfly comes out. A butterfly is sometimes called an imago. It is also called an adult. Butterflies are very colorful. When the butterfly first comes out its wings are damp. The wings are also soft. The wings are folded against its body. The butterfly is also very tired. So the butterfly rests.</p>
       	<p class="finalstage-text">Once the butterfly has rested, it will be ready to start flying. It will start to pump blood into its wings. This is to get them working and flapping. After it does this, it can now learn to fly. Butterflies cannot fly good at first. They need a lot of practice. It does not take long for them to learn. They learn fast. When it can fly, it will go look for food. The butterfly will also go look for a mate. It will soon find a mate. It will then lay eggs. The lifecycle will start all over again.</p>
